<Warning title="deprecated">
The Neon Azure Native Integration is deprecated and reaches end of life on **January 31, 2026**. After this date, Azure-managed organizations will no longer be available. [Migrate your projects to a Neon-managed organization](/import/migrate-from-azure-native) to continue using Neon.
</Warning>

## Key benefits

Deploying Neon natively on Azure lets you manage your Neon organization alongside the rest of your Azure infrastructure. Key benefits include:

- **Azure-native management**: Provision and manage Neon organizations directly from the Azure portal.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: Access Neon using your Azure credentials; no separate logins required.
- **Consolidated billing**: Simplify cost management with unified billing through the Azure Marketplace.
- **Integrated workflows**: Use the Azure CLI and SDKs to manage Neon as part of your regular workflows, integrated with your existing Azure resources.
