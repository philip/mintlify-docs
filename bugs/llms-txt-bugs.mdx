description: "Documented issues in Mintlify's llms.txt and .md generation system"

All four bugs were reproduced on `me-8e8b8f86.mintlify.app`, a test Neon docs migration site.

View the live [llms.txt output](https://me-8e8b8f86.mintlify.app/llms.txt) to see these issues. Look for `[null]` titles, empty `[]` titles, and bloated multi-paragraph descriptions on API reference entries.

The bloated description bug is not contrived. This site pulls in the real [Neon API spec](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json), and many of its operation descriptions end up dumped verbatim into `llms.txt`.

| Bug | Severity | Suggested fix |
| --- | -------- | ------------- |
| [Null titles in llms.txt](#bug-1-null-titles-in-llmstxt) | High | Validate OpenAPI-derived titles; apply same rules as MDX pages |
| [Bloated descriptions from OpenAPI specs](#bug-2-bloated-descriptions-in-llmstxt-from-openapi-specs) | Medium | Truncate/sanitize llms.txt descriptions; warn on long OpenAPI operation descriptions |

## Bug 1: Null titles in llms.txt

**Severity:** High

Pages can end up with `[null]` as their title in `llms.txt`. This happens when an MDX page uses the `openapi` frontmatter field but has **no `title`** field. Mintlify resolves the title from the OpenAPI operation's `summary`. When `summary` is missing, the title becomes the literal string `null`.

### How to reproduce

1. Add an operation without a `summary` field to your OpenAPI spec:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "info": { "title": "Test API", "version": "1.0.0" },
  "paths": {
    "/plants/ghost": {
      "get": {
        "responses": {
          "200": { "description": "OK" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Create an MDX page with `openapi` frontmatter but no `title`:

```yaml
---
openapi: 'GET /plants/ghost'
---
```

3. Build and deploy. The `llms.txt` entry will be:

```
- [null](https://example.com/bug-demos/null-title-c.md)
```

The `.md` output will literally contain `# null` as the page heading.

<Note>`mint openapi-check` passes for this spec. The validation does not flag missing `summary` fields, so there is no build-time warning before the `[null]` title appears in llms.txt.</Note>

### Variants tested

| MDX file | OpenAPI operation | llms.txt title | Realistic? |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| `openapi: 'GET /plants'`, no `title` | Has `description`, no `summary` | `[null]` | **Yes, common.** Many real specs omit `summary` and only use `description`. |
| `openapi: 'GET /nonexistent'`, no `title` | Doesn't exist in spec | `[null]` | Edge case. |
| `openapi: 'GET /plants/ghost'`, no `title` | No `summary`, no `description` | `[null]` | Edge case. |
| `openapi: 'GET /plants/minimal'`, no `title` | `summary: ""` (empty string) | `[]` (empty) | Edge case. |

The first variant is the high-impact case. It is common for OpenAPI specs to have a `description` but no `summary` on operations.

<Accordion title="MDX approach vs auto-generated approach">
When operations are referenced directly in `docs.json` navigation (without MDX files), Mintlify has a fallback that derives the title from the HTTP method and path:

```json
{
  "group": "Auto-generated",
  "openapi": "api-reference/openapi.json",
  "pages": [
    "GET /plants/ghost",
    "GET /plants/minimal"
  ]
}
```

| Approach | Spec `summary` | Title in llms.txt |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| MDX file with `openapi` frontmatter, no `title` | missing | `[null]` |
| MDX file with `openapi` frontmatter, no `title` | `""` | `[]` (empty) |
| Auto-generated (operation in navigation) | missing | `[Get plantsghost]` (path-derived fallback) |
| Auto-generated (operation in navigation) | `""` | `[]` (empty) |

The auto-generated approach avoids `[null]` by falling back to the path. The MDX approach has no such fallback.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why plain MDX pages can't trigger this">
Mintlify's build validation requires a `title` field in frontmatter for non-OpenAPI MDX pages. Omitting `title`, setting `title: ""`, and removing frontmatter entirely all fail `mint validate`. Only the `openapi` frontmatter field bypasses this requirement.
</Accordion>

### Suggested fixes

1. Apply the same title validation to OpenAPI pages that already exists for plain MDX pages. If `summary` is missing or empty and no `title` is provided, either fail the build or fall back to the path-derived title.
2. Flag or fail the build if `[null]` or `[]` appears as a title in the generated `llms.txt`.

## Bug 2: Bloated descriptions in llms.txt from OpenAPI specs

**Severity:** Medium

Some pages have massive multi-paragraph descriptions dumped into `llms.txt`, including Markdown headings, bullet lists, and code examples. This content belongs in the page body, not in a one-line summary.

### Root cause

Mintlify uses the OpenAPI operation's `description` field as the `llms.txt` description (the text after the colon on each line). When spec authors write extensive Markdown content (with `###` headings, lists, etc.) in the operation `description`, it all ends up verbatim in `llms.txt`.

<Note>The OpenAPI `summary` field is already used as the page title (link text in llms.txt). The `description` field is used as the llms.txt description (text after the colon). These are separate concerns.</Note>

### How to reproduce

Add an operation with a verbose `description` to your OpenAPI spec:

```yaml
paths:
  /webhooks/subscriptions:
    post:
      summary: Create webhook subscription
      description: >
        Subscribe to real-time transfer status events.

        ### Event Types

        **Events**:
        - item.registered
        - item.match.found
        - item.match.confirmed

        ### Webhook Signature Verification
        All webhooks include cryptographic signatures.

        ### Retry Policy
        Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff.
```

The entire `description` value (including `###` headings, bullet lists, and multiple paragraphs) is dumped verbatim into `llms.txt` as a single line.

### Why this happens in practice

- API engineers write comprehensive `description` fields in OpenAPI specs (it's the natural place for endpoint documentation)
- Mintlify auto-generates pages from the spec, using `description` as the frontmatter description
- The HTML pages look fine (Markdown renders nicely), but `llms.txt` dumps it all inline
- Nobody reviews `llms.txt` output since it's auto-generated and only produced on deploy, not locally

<Accordion title="Real-world example (Coinbase)">
The Coinbase docs at `https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/llms.txt` exhibited this at time of writing (may have since been updated). Their `create-webhook-subscription` endpoint's OpenAPI spec contains:

```yaml
paths:
  /v2/data/webhooks/subscriptions:
    post:
      summary: Create webhook subscription
      description: >
        Subscribe to real-time transfer status events.

        ### Event Types

        **Payments Transfers Events** - Transfer lifecycle notifications:
        - payments.transfers.quoted
        - payments.transfers.processing
        - payments.transfers.completed
        - payments.transfers.failed

        ### Webhook Signature Verification
        All webhooks include cryptographic signatures for security.
```

This entire `description` field ends up as the page's `llms.txt` entry description: hundreds of characters of structured Markdown content on a single line.
</Accordion>

### Suggested fixes

1. Truncate the `description` to a reasonable length (first sentence or ~200 chars) when generating llms.txt. The full content is available in the `.md` file.
2. Strip Markdown structure (headings, lists, code blocks) from the description before inserting into llms.txt.
3. Warn during build when an OpenAPI operation `description` exceeds a threshold or contains heading syntax.
4. `npx mint openapi-check` should flag operations with oversized or Markdown-heavy `description` fields that will produce bloated llms.txt entries.

## Bug 3: Internal theme config leaks into code blocks

**Severity:** Low

Every code block in the `.md` output has a `theme=...` directive appended to the info string. This is a Mintlify-internal rendering prop with no meaning in standard Markdown.

### Observed behavior

Source MDX:

````markdown
```python
import mylib
client = mylib.Client(api_key="sk_live_abc123")
```
````

Generated `.md` output:

````markdown
```python Python theme={"system"}
import mylib
client = mylib.Client(api_key="sk_live_abc123")
```
````

The value changes based on `docs.json` configuration:

- **No codeblocks config:** `theme={null}`
- **With `"codeblocks": "system"`:** `theme={"system"}`

The generated `.md` also inserts the **language label** (e.g., `Python`) into the info string. Any LLM or tool consuming the `.md` output will see `python Python theme={"system"}` as the code fence info string, which could confuse language detection and parsing.

### How to reproduce

Deploy any Mintlify site with code blocks and check the `.md` output for any page (e.g., `https://your-site.mintlify.app/any-page.md`). Every code block will have `theme={...}` appended.

### Suggested fix

Strip internal theme props before generating `.md` output.

## Bug 4: Default-ignored files leak into llms.txt with seo.indexing: all

**Severity:** Medium
**Active on this site:** Yes (`seo.indexing: "all"` is enabled in `docs.json`)

Mintlify auto-ignores certain files from publishing: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and others. However, setting `seo.indexing: "all"` in `docs.json` overrides this and pulls them into `llms.txt`.

### How to reproduce

1. Add `seo.indexing: "all"` to `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
  }
}
```

2. Have an `AGENTS.md` (or `README.md`, etc.) in your docs directory without YAML frontmatter.

3. Build and deploy. The `llms.txt` will include:

```
- [null](https://example.com/AGENTS.md)
```

### What seo.indexing: all does and doesn't do

| Page type | Default | With `seo.indexing: "all"` |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Default-ignored files (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, etc.) | Excluded from llms.txt | **Included**, often as `[null]` (no frontmatter) |
| `hidden: true` in frontmatter | Excluded from llms.txt | Still excluded |
| Hidden nav group (`"hidden": true`) | Excluded from llms.txt | Still excluded |
| `.mintignore` files | Excluded entirely | Still excluded |

<Accordion title="Additional findings on hidden pages">
We tested all exclusion mechanisms:

- **`hidden: true` in frontmatter:** Correctly excluded from `llms.txt` in all cases
- **Hidden navigation group (`"hidden": true` on group):** Correctly excluded from `llms.txt`
- **`.mintignore`:** Completely excluded from the site (404), but does NOT remove `docs.json` nav entries. You'll get a broken nav link if you reference a `.mintignore`d file in navigation.
- **`seo.indexing: "all"`:** Only re-includes default-ignored files (like `AGENTS.md`), does NOT override `hidden: true`
</Accordion>

### Suggested fixes

1. When `seo.indexing: "all"` is enabled, still skip files that lack YAML frontmatter. These are clearly not documentation pages.
2. Document the side effect: the `seo.indexing: "all"` docs should warn that it re-includes default-ignored files in AI context.

## Bug 5: llms.txt ignores navigation structure

**Severity:** Medium

The `llms.txt` output is a single flat alphabetical list of all pages. It does not reflect the tab or group structure defined in `docs.json`.

### Observed behavior

All pages are listed under one `## Docs` heading, sorted by URL path. Pages from separate tabs (e.g., "API Reference", "Bug Repros", "AI") are interleaved alphabetically rather than grouped.

For example, auto-generated pages from a second OpenAPI spec under a "Bug Repros" tab appear between `api-reference/endpoint/` and `api-reference/operation/` entries because the generated paths (`api-reference/get-plants*`) sort there alphabetically.

### Expected behavior

The `llms.txt` should reflect the navigation hierarchy. Each tab or top-level group should be a separate `##` section:

```
## Docs
- ...

## AI
- ...

## API Reference
- ...

## Bug Repros
- ...
```

### Why this matters

The `llms.txt` format exists to help LLMs understand site structure. A flat alphabetical list provides no structural context. The navigation hierarchy is already defined in `docs.json` and should be reused.

### Suggested fix

Group `llms.txt` entries by tab (and optionally by group within each tab) instead of outputting a single flat list.

## Test site

All bugs were reproduced on `me-8e8b8f86.mintlify.app`. The test site used:

- Mintlify's standard MDX documentation setup
- An OpenAPI spec with deliberately malformed operations (missing `summary`, empty `summary`, no `description`)
- MDX pages with `openapi` frontmatter referencing those operations
- `docs.json` navigation mixing MDX pages and auto-generated OpenAPI pages
- `hidden: true` frontmatter, hidden navigation groups, and `.mintignore` for exclusion testing
- `seo.indexing: "all"` to test override behavior

<Accordion title="Reproduction spec">
A standalone reproduction spec is available at `bugs/openapi-bug-repro.json`. This spec passes `npx mint openapi-check` with no warnings.
