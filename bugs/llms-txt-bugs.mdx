View the live [llms.txt output](https://me-8e8b8f86.mintlify.app/llms.txt) to see these issues. Look for `[null]` and `[]` titles, and multi-paragraph descriptions on API reference entries.

This site pulls in the real [Neon API spec](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json), and many of its lengthy operation descriptions end up dumped into `llms.txt`.

## Bug 1: Broken titles in llms.txt from OpenAPI operations

**Severity:** High

When an OpenAPI operation has no `summary` field, the generated `llms.txt` title is broken. The exact result depends on how pages are generated.

### How to reproduce

1. Add operations without `summary` to your OpenAPI spec:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "info": { "title": "Test API", "version": "1.0.0" },
  "paths": {
    "/plants": {
      "get": {
        "description": "Returns all plants",
        "responses": { "200": { "description": "OK" } }
      }
    },
    "/plants/ghost": {
      "get": {
        "responses": { "200": { "description": "OK" } }
      }
    },
    "/plants/minimal": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "",
        "responses": { "200": { "description": "OK" } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Reference the spec in `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "tab": "API Reference",
  "openapi": "path/to/spec.json"
}
```

3. Build and deploy. The `llms.txt` titles will be:

| Operation | `summary` | llms.txt title |
| --------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `GET /plants` | missing (has `description`) | `[Get plants]` |
| `GET /plants/ghost` | missing | `[Get plantsghost]` |
| `GET /plants/minimal` | `""` (empty string) | `[]` (empty) |

Mintlify falls back to a path-derived title when `summary` is missing. The fallback strips slashes and title-cases, producing results like `Get plantsghost` (no space). When `summary` is explicitly `""`, the title becomes `[]`.

See the **"Null title bug (auto-generated)"** group in the Bug Repros tab for live examples.

<Note>`mint openapi-check` passes for this spec. It does not flag missing `summary` fields, so there is no build-time warning.</Note>

<Accordion title="MDX approach is worse: produces literal [null]">
You can also create individual `.mdx` files with `openapi` frontmatter instead of letting Mintlify auto-generate pages. This file has no `title`, only `openapi: "GET /plants/ghost"`:

See `bugs/mdx-null-title.mdx` and the **"Null title bug (MDX approach)"** group in the Bug Repros tab.

With this approach, Mintlify has no path-derived fallback. A missing `summary` produces literal `[null]` as the title, and `# null` as the `.md` page heading.

| Approach | `summary` | llms.txt title |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Auto-generated (no MDX file) | missing | Path-derived (e.g., `[Get plantsghost]`) |
| Auto-generated (no MDX file) | `""` | `[]` |
| MDX with `openapi` frontmatter | missing | `[null]` |
| MDX with `openapi` frontmatter | `""` | `[]` |

Many real specs omit `summary` and only use `description`, including Neon's spec.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why plain MDX pages can't trigger this">
Mintlify's build validation requires a `title` field in frontmatter for non-OpenAPI MDX pages. Omitting `title`, setting `title: ""`, and removing frontmatter entirely all fail `mint validate`. Only the `openapi` frontmatter field bypasses this requirement.
</Accordion>

### Suggested fixes

1. When `summary` is missing, use a well-formatted path-derived title (with proper spacing) or fail the build.
2. Flag the build if `[null]`, `[]`, or malformed path-derived titles appear in `llms.txt`.

## Bug 2: Untruncated OpenAPI descriptions in llms.txt

**Severity:** Medium

OpenAPI operation `description` fields are included verbatim in `llms.txt`, including Markdown headings, bullet lists, and multi-paragraph content. This detail belongs in the `.md` page, not the index.

### Root cause

Mintlify uses the OpenAPI operation's `description` field as the `llms.txt` description. When a spec includes Markdown content (headings, lists, etc.) in the operation `description`, it all ends up verbatim in `llms.txt`.

<Note>The `summary` field becomes the page title (link text). The `description` field becomes the entry description (text after the colon). These are separate fields with separate roles.</Note>

### How to reproduce

Add an operation with a verbose `description` to your OpenAPI spec:

```yaml
paths:
  /webhooks/subscriptions:
    post:
      summary: Create webhook subscription
      description: >
        Subscribe to real-time transfer status events.

        ### Event Types

        **Events**:
        - item.registered
        - item.match.found
        - item.match.confirmed

        ### Webhook Signature Verification
        All webhooks include cryptographic signatures.

        ### Retry Policy
        Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff.
```

The entire `description` value ends up as a single line in `llms.txt`, Markdown syntax included.

### Why this happens in practice

- Spec authors naturally write detailed `description` fields for their endpoints
- The rendered HTML pages look fine because the Markdown renders correctly
- `llms.txt` is auto-generated on deploy and rarely reviewed

<Accordion title="Real-world example (Coinbase)">
The Coinbase docs at `https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/llms.txt` exhibited this at time of writing (may have since been updated). Their `create-webhook-subscription` endpoint's OpenAPI spec contains:

```yaml
paths:
  /v2/data/webhooks/subscriptions:
    post:
      summary: Create webhook subscription
      description: >
        Subscribe to real-time transfer status events.

        ### Event Types

        **Payments Transfers Events** - Transfer lifecycle notifications:
        - payments.transfers.quoted
        - payments.transfers.processing
        - payments.transfers.completed
        - payments.transfers.failed

        ### Webhook Signature Verification
        All webhooks include cryptographic signatures for security.
```

This entire `description` field ends up as a single entry in `llms.txt`, raw Markdown and all.
</Accordion>

### Suggested fixes

1. Truncate descriptions to the first sentence or ~200 characters. The full content is in the `.md` file.
2. Strip Markdown syntax (headings, lists, code blocks) from the description before writing to `llms.txt`.
3. Warn during build when an operation `description` exceeds a length threshold or contains heading syntax.
4. `npx mint openapi-check` should flag long or Markdown-heavy `description` fields?

## Bug 3: Internal theme config leaks into code blocks

**Severity:** Low

Code blocks in `.md` output have a `theme=...` directive appended to the info string. This is a Mintlify-internal prop with no meaning in standard Markdown.

### Observed behavior

Source MDX:

````markdown
```python
import mylib
client = mylib.Client(api_key="sk_live_abc123")
```
````

Generated `.md` output:

````markdown
```python Python theme={"system"}
import mylib
client = mylib.Client(api_key="sk_live_abc123")
```
````

The value changes based on `docs.json` configuration:

- **No codeblocks config:** `theme={null}`
- **With `"codeblocks": "system"`:** `theme={"system"}`

The `.md` also inserts the language label (e.g., `Python`) into the info string. Tools consuming the output will see `python Python theme={"system"}` as the code fence info string, which can confuse language detection.

### How to reproduce

Deploy any Mintlify site with code blocks and check the `.md` output for any page (e.g., `https://your-site.mintlify.app/any-page.md`).

### Suggested fix

Strip internal theme props before generating `.md` output.

## Bug 4: Default-ignored files leak into llms.txt with seo.indexing: all

**Severity:** Medium
**Active on this site:** Yes (`seo.indexing: "all"` is enabled in `docs.json`)

Mintlify auto-ignores certain files (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, etc.). Setting `seo.indexing: "all"` overrides this and pulls them into `llms.txt`.

### How to reproduce

1. Add `seo.indexing: "all"` to `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
  }
}
```

2. Have an `AGENTS.md` (or `README.md`, etc.) in your docs directory without YAML frontmatter.

3. Build and deploy. The `llms.txt` will include:

```
- [null](https://example.com/AGENTS.md)
```

### What seo.indexing: all does and doesn't do

| Page type | Default | With `seo.indexing: "all"` |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Default-ignored files (`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, etc.) | Excluded from llms.txt | **Included**, often as `[null]` (no frontmatter) |
| `hidden: true` in frontmatter | Excluded from llms.txt | Still excluded |
| Hidden nav group (`"hidden": true`) | Excluded from llms.txt | Still excluded |
| `.mintignore` files | Excluded entirely | Still excluded |

<Accordion title="Additional findings on hidden pages">
We tested all exclusion mechanisms:

- **`hidden: true` in frontmatter:** Correctly excluded from `llms.txt` in all cases
- **Hidden navigation group (`"hidden": true` on group):** Correctly excluded from `llms.txt`
- **`.mintignore`:** Completely excluded from the site (404), but does NOT remove `docs.json` nav entries. You'll get a broken nav link if you reference a `.mintignore`d file in navigation.
- **`seo.indexing: "all"`:** Only re-includes default-ignored files (like `AGENTS.md`), does NOT override `hidden: true`
</Accordion>

### Suggested fixes

1. When `seo.indexing: "all"` is enabled, still skip files that lack YAML frontmatter.
2. Document the side effect in the `seo.indexing` docs.

## Bug 5: llms.txt ignores navigation structure

**Severity:** Medium

`llms.txt` is a single flat alphabetical list. It does not reflect the tab or group structure from `docs.json`.

### Observed behavior

All pages are listed under one `## Docs` heading, sorted by URL path. Pages from separate tabs (e.g., "API Reference", "Bug Repros", "AI") are interleaved alphabetically rather than grouped.

For example, auto-generated pages from a second OpenAPI spec under a "Bug Repros" tab appear between `api-reference/endpoint/` and `api-reference/operation/` entries because the generated paths (`api-reference/get-plants*`) sort there alphabetically.

### Expected behavior

The `llms.txt` should reflect the navigation hierarchy. Each tab or top-level group should be a separate `##` section:

```
## Docs
- ...

## AI
- ...

## API Reference
- ...

## Bug Repros
- ...
```

### Why this matters

`llms.txt` exists to help LLMs understand site structure. A flat alphabetical list provides no structural context. The navigation hierarchy is already in `docs.json` and should be reused.

### Suggested fix

Group `llms.txt` entries by tab (and optionally by group within each tab) instead of outputting a single flat list.

## Test site

All bugs were reproduced on `me-8e8b8f86.mintlify.app` using:

- An OpenAPI spec with missing/empty `summary` fields
- MDX pages with `openapi` frontmatter referencing those operations
- Mixed MDX and auto-generated OpenAPI pages in navigation
- `hidden: true`, hidden groups, and `.mintignore` for exclusion testing
- `seo.indexing: "all"` enabled
