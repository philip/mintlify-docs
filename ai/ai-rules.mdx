subtitle: Enhance your AI development experience with Neon-specific context rules
description: >-
  Covers the setup of AI context rules for Neon, including installation
  instructions for Claude Code and Cursor plugins plus individual context rule
  files for other AI tools, enhancing code suggestions and reducing errors.

Boost your productivity with AI context rules for Neon. These rules help AI assistants understand Neon's features, leading to more accurate code suggestions and fewer common mistakes.

If you're using **Claude Code** or **Cursor**, install the Neon plugin to bundle Skills and MCP integration in one package. For other AI tools, use the individual `.mdc` context rule files.

## Plugin install

If you're using Claude Code or Cursor, install a Neon plugin to get Skills and MCP integration:

## Individual AI rules

For other AI tools like Cursor, you can use these individual `.mdc` context rule files. Copy them to your AI tool's custom rules directory; the format is tool-agnostic and works with any AI assistant that supports context rules.

## How it works

AI rules are `.mdc` files that specify which types of files they apply to (such as `*.tsx` or `schema.sql`). When you're working with a matching file, your AI tool automatically applies the relevant rules to provide better suggestions.

### Example: AI rules in action

Here's a practical example using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so). A developer has implemented authentication in their server-rendered page and wants to confirm best practices:

**Developer query**: _"Using the neon-auth.mdc rule, how do I secure a server-rendered page?"_

![Screenshot of Cursor applying the neon-auth.mdc rule](/images/docs/ai/ai-rules.png)

The AI confirms that using `stackServerApp.getUser({ or: "redirect" })` is the correct approach for server-side authentication, providing additional context and explanation.

## Add rules to your project

All `.mdc` files are available in the [Neon AI Rules toolkit repository](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules). Copy the files you need to your project's `.cursor/rules` folder (or your AI tool's equivalent):

```text
.cursor/
  rules/
    neon-auth.mdc
    neon-serverless.mdc
    neon-drizzle.mdc
    neon-toolkit.mdc
    neon-typescript-sdk.mdc
    neon-python-sdk.mdc
    neon-api-guidelines.mdc
    neon-api-projects.mdc
    neon-api-branches.mdc
    neon-api-endpoints.mdc
    neon-api-organizations.mdc
    neon-api-keys.mdc
    neon-api-operations.mdc
```

Most AI tools will automatically apply these rules when you're working with Neon-related code. You can also reference them explicitly in prompts for more targeted assistance.
