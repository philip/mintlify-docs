Neon's logical replication feature, available to all Neon users, allows you to replicate data to and from your Neon Postgres database:

- Stream data from your Neon database to external destinations, enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. External sources might include data warehouses, analytical database services, real-time stream processing systems, messaging and event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases, among others. See [Replicate data from Neon](#replicate-data-from-neon).
- Perform live migrations to Neon from external sources such as AWS RDS and Google Cloud SQL &#8212; or any platform that runs Postgres. See [Replicate data to Neon](#replicate-data-to-neon).
- Replicate data from one Neon project to another for Neon project, account, Postgres version, or region migration. See [Replicate data from one Neon project to another](/guides/logical-replication-neon-to-neon).

Logical replication in Neon works like it does on any standard Postgres installation. It uses a publisher-subscriber model to replicate data from the source database to the destination database. Neon can act as a publisher or subscriber.

Replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the publisher to the subscriber. Once this is done, subsequent changes are sent to the subscriber as they occur in real-time.
