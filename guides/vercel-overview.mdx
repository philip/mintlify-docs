## Choose your integration path

<Warning title="Do you need custom CI/CD control?">
**If you want to build preview branching into your own CI/CD pipelines (for example, via GitHub Actions)**, use a **[manual connection](/guides/vercel-manual)** instead of the automated integrations below.
</Warning>

For automated integrations, follow this simple flow:

<Steps>

## Do you have an existing Neon account?

**Do you already have a Neon account or project you want to keep using?**

- **✅ Yes** → Use **[Neon-Managed Integration](/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration)**
- **❌ No** → Continue below

## Choose your billing preference

**Where would you like to manage billing for Neon?**

- **Through my Vercel account** → Use **[Vercel-Managed Integration](/guides/vercel-managed-integration)**
- **Directly with Neon** → Use **[Neon-Managed Integration](/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration)**

</Steps>
