title: Neon SDKs
description: >-
  Covers the setup of Client and Management SDKs for Neon, enabling application
  developers to implement user authentication and database queries, as well as
  manage platform resources programmatically.
---

Neon provides two categories of SDKs to support different use cases:

- **Client SDKs**: For application developers building apps with [Neon Auth](/auth/overview) and the [Data API](/data-api/overview). These SDKs handle user authentication and database queries from your application.
- **Management SDKs**: For programmatically managing Neon platform resources like projects, branches, databases, endpoints, and roles. These are wrappers around the [Neon API](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

## Client SDKs

Use these SDKs to build applications with Neon Auth and the Data API.

## Management SDKs

Use these SDKs to programmatically manage your Neon infrastructure (projects, branches, databases, endpoints, roles, and operations).

## Community SDKs

<Note>
Community SDKs are not maintained or officially supported by Neon. Some features may be out of date, so use these SDKs at your own discretion. If you have questions about these SDKs, please contact the project maintainers.
