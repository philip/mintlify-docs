<NeonApiPrompt />

The Neon API allows you to manage your Neon projects programmatically. You can create and manage projects, branches, databases, roles, compute endpoints, and more. Everything you can do in the Neon Console, you can do with the API.

## Quick links

- [Neon API Reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api): Interactive API documentation with "Try It" feature
- [OpenAPI Specification](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json): Machine-readable API spec (OpenAPI 3.0)
- [Neon SDKs](/reference/sdk): TypeScript and Python SDKs for the Neon API

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Neon API, you need:

1. **A Neon account**: [Sign up](https://console.neon.tech/signup) if you don't have one
2. **An API key**: Create one in the Neon Console (see below)
3. **curl or an HTTP client**: Or use our [TypeScript](/reference/typescript-sdk) or [Python](/reference/python-sdk) SDKs

### API key types

Neon supports three types of API keys, each with different scopes:

| Key Type                   | Scope                                  | Best For                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Personal API Key**       | All projects you own or have access to | Personal development, scripts |
| **Organization API Key**   | All projects within an organization    | Team automation, CI/CD        |
| **Project-scoped API Key** | Single project only                    | Limited access integrations   |

Create your first API key in the Neon Console under **Account settings** > **API keys**. For detailed instructions, see [Manage API keys](/manage/api-keys).

<Warning>
API key tokens are shown only once at creation. Store them securely; you cannot retrieve them later.
</Warning>

### Base URL

All API requests use this base URL:

```text
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/
```

### Authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header using Bearer authentication:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

## Make your first API call

Set your API key as an environment variable, then list your projects:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="curl">

```bash
# Set your API key
export NEON_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# List all projects
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" | jq
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript SDK">

```bash
npm install @neondatabase/api-client
```

```typescript
import { createApiClient } from '@neondatabase/api-client';

const apiClient = createApiClient({
  apiKey: process.env.NEON_API_KEY!,
});

async function listProjects() {
  const response = await apiClient.listProjects({});
  console.log(response.data.projects);
}

listProjects();
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Python SDK">

```bash
pip install neon-api
```

```python
import os
from neon_api import NeonAPI

neon = NeonAPI(api_key=os.environ["NEON_API_KEY"])

projects = neon.projects()
print(projects)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The response includes your projects with their IDs, regions, and other details:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "id": "spring-example-302709",
      "name": "my-project",
      "region_id": "aws-us-east-2",
      "pg_version": 17,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `project_id` from the response to make subsequent requests, such as creating a branch:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="curl">

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/spring-example-302709/branches' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"branch": {"name": "dev-branch"}}'
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="TypeScript SDK">

```typescript
const response = await apiClient.createProjectBranch('spring-example-302709', {
  branch: { name: 'dev-branch' },
});
console.log(response.data.branch);
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Python SDK">

```python
branch = neon.branch_create(
    project_id="spring-example-302709",
    branch={"name": "dev-branch"}
)
print(branch)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Key concepts

### Asynchronous operations

Many Neon API operations (creating branches, starting computes, etc.) are asynchronous. The API response includes an `operations` array with status information:

```json
"operations": [
  {
    "id": "22acbb37-209b-4b90-a39c-8460090e1329",
    "action": "create_branch",
    "status": "running"
  }
]
```

**Status values:** `scheduling`, `running`, `finished`, `failed`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `skipped`

When building automation, poll the operation status before proceeding with dependent requests:

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/operations/{operation_id}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
```

For details, see [Poll operation status](/manage/operations#poll-operation-status).

### Rate limiting

- **700 requests per minute** (approximately 11 per second)
- **40 requests per second** burst limit per route

Exceeding these limits returns `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in your applications.

### Pagination

Some endpoints that return lists support cursor-based pagination. Include `limit` and `cursor` parameters:

```bash
# First request with limit
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?limit=10' ...

# Subsequent request with cursor from previous response
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?limit=10&cursor=...' ...
```

## SDKs and tools

Instead of using curl, you can use our official SDKs:

- **[TypeScript SDK](/reference/typescript-sdk)**: Full-featured SDK for Node.js and browser
- **[Python SDK](/reference/python-sdk)**: Pythonic wrapper for the Neon API
- **[@neondatabase/toolkit](/reference/neondatabase-toolkit)**: Combined SDK for AI agents (includes API SDK + Serverless Driver)
- **[Neon CLI](/reference/neon-cli)**: Command-line interface for Neon

See [Neon SDKs](/reference/sdk) for the full list, including community SDKs.

## API reference documentation

The interactive [Neon API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api) provides:

- Complete endpoint documentation
- Request/response examples
- "Try It" feature to execute requests directly
- Schema definitions for all objects

You can also access the [OpenAPI specification](https://neon.com/api_spec/release/v2.json) directly for code generation or API tooling.
