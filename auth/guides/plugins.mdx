<FeatureBetaProps feature_name="Neon Auth with Better Auth" />

Neon Auth is built on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), which supports a variety of plugins to extend authentication functionality.

<Info title="Plugins are managed by Neon Auth">
Neon Auth is a **managed** Better Auth service. You **don’t install or configure Better Auth plugins directly** - instead, Neon Auth exposes a supported subset of plugins through the Neon SDK.

More granular controls like enabling/disabling specific plugins and customizing plugin behavior are on the roadmap.
</Info>

The following Better Auth plugins are currently supported in Neon Auth:
